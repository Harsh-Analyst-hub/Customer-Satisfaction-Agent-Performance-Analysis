# Customer-Satisfaction-Agent-Performance-Analysis
### üîç Project Overview

This project is an **Excel-based dashboard and analysis** built to assess the performance of service agents based on various metrics such as **training level, customer satisfaction, call volume, and case priority**. The goal is to derive actionable insights that help in improving service quality and team efficiency.

* **Employee Level Performance**:

  * **Regular employees** handle the highest volume of cases (**1,523 cases**).
  * Senior and Junior agents also show significant case handling capacity.

* **Priority Distribution**:

  * **High-priority cases** total **1,217**, combining both issues and requests.
  * Ensuring proper agent allocation for high-priority cases is crucial for service efficiency.
